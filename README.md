# GetFunctionFormulaFromPhoto
Program analyzes given photo of hand-drawn linear/quadratic function and returns its formula.

After few image processing steps, using openCV library and custom-made Hough Transform for parabolas, the program is able to detect whether 
photo presents linear or quadratic function (or neither of them). After that, the function formula is generated.

Program works for rotated images too.
